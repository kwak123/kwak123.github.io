Two glowing reviews of [Advanced Mac OS X Programming](/books/advanced-mac-osx-programming/) have appeared:




  * [OSNews](http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=12516) says "Advanced programmers who need to port or write a Unix-based application or service for OSX, should definitely get "Advanced Mac OS X Programming" for it is the most in-depth guide for the internals of Mac OS X."


  * [Bill Bumgarner](http://www.friday.com/bbum/2005/11/03/advanced-mac-os-x-programming/) says "The first edition saved me many hours of research while often answering questions that I didn't realize I needed to ask. I'm confident that the updated version will do the same."
